Simple Product Display
======================

Purpose
-------
I made this primarily because I wanted to see if I could profitably convert
various display network/niche communities into amazon affiliate traffic. A
secondary goal was to play around with rails 4.


Todo
----


* Refactor homepage, I really don't like that products#show is rendering to the 
homepage. If nothing else it should be rendered as a show partial. 
* Email subscription for new products. 
* Add direct links to amazon for now until affiliate account is approved.
