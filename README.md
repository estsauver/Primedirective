Simple Product Display
======================

Purpose
-------
I made this primarily because I wanted to see if I could profitably convert
various display network/niche communities into amazon affiliate traffic. A
secondary goal was to play around with rails 4.


Todo
----

* Add direct links to amazon for now until affiliate account is approved. 
* Refactor homepage_spec, to use the products list that's been created more
  effecively. 
* Mockout mailchimp requests to speed up tests.
