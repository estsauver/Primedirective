Simple Product Display
======================

Purpose
-------
Edit: It became clear when I was writing this that there was actually a much
more obvious use case: making it easier to remember people's birthdays. Since
I'm sure that I'll use this even if no one else does it seems like an obvious
thing to build.

Previously:
I made this primarily because I wanted to see if I could profitably convert
various display network/niche communities into amazon affiliate traffic. A
secondary goal was to play around with rails 4.


Todo
----
* Add more products to homepage
* Make simple_format description
* Integrate Products API
* Add facebook friends's birthdays.
* Grab amazon wishlists
* Add landing page
* Add photo grid to display products.
* Refactor homepage spec, to use the products list that's been created more
  effecively.

Done
-----
* Mockout mailchimp requests to speed up tests. (Used vcr instead.)

Pending. I don't know if I actually want to open source this or not. If you'd
like to use this give my email a ring and we'll work something out.
