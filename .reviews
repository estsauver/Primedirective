An Arduino.

Have a friend who likes computers, programming, or some sort of technology? Well there's a stupidly easy and suprrisingly cheap gift they'll really love: An Arduino. 

One of the hard things about computers is that they tend to be very limimted in what they can do. Usually no matter what you do with a computer, only the colors of some LCD's change. Arduino's bridge this gap and let you interact with the physical world from your computer.

As a little tiny microprocessor tehse are amazing because they let you program small pieces of hardware in ways that weren't possible before.  

600 Glowsticks

So you have a friend who has a wild spirit, or someone who's really a lo tmore into "experiences" then physical objects and don't know what to get them? There's nothing like 1000 glowsticks to really make their whatever special. 

These glowsticks last a surprisingly long time and can be chained together to make good quality little bracelets or acceptable necklaces. For ~[Price] they really take a party from "I guess this was fun" to "Holy Hell."

Bluetooth Headphones

There's nothing more annyoing then teh falpping headphones cord that slaps you while you're running and makes your earbuds fall out while you're about to run a personal record. These are great exactly because they will *never* get pulled off your head and you'll never have to pause your music because you're standing up. 

These will *just work* with an iPhone and every Android phone I've ever seen. They worked with a 2011 macbook air and I think they'll work with most more recent windows laptops too.  

P.S. Did I mention that you can change the track or the volume without taking out your phone? That feature by itself has kept me from dropping my phone a half dozen times. 

Sugru

This stuff is amazing and it's what I always wished Play-Doh had been. Sugru is an amazing quick drying rubber-like compound that I've used so far to

* fix my computers power cable, saving me the 80$ cost of replacement. 
* build a toothbrush holder
* replace the small little pad on the bottom of my computer that fell off.

If you want to get someone a gift that they'll remember as being incredibly awesome and handy, you can either buy them a roll of duck tape and be weirdly tacky, or you can give them a little pack of sugru and you'll be a part of their life forever.

Tea Tree Oil

Men who are reading this looking for a gift for a woman: Stop here and just get this. To be totally honest, I don't really understand the differences between cosmetic products. I'd be a really terrible Avon lady. I scrub my face with the cheap stuff from CVS and I seem to have avoided having exploding pores. But most women are on a whole different plane of cosmetics-existence. 

Do you know what non-comodogenic means? No? WHat about the difference between X or Y? No? You're not qualified for this. If you go in without help there's a real chance you'll buy something that implies she's ugly or that's for blackheads and she had one last week and I can't believe you. Just don't do it. You can't pick randomly, you need useful but innocuous. That's what this is. It's used for... I don't actually know. It's made out of... tea trees?  

Look, it will make her smile, whether it's your mom or your girlfriend.
