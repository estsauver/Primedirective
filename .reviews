An Arduino.

Have a friend who likes computers, programming, or some sort of technology? Well there's a stupidly easy and suprrisingly cheap gift they'll really love: An Arduino. 

One of the hard things about computers is that they tend to be very limimted in what they can do. Usually no matter what you do with a computer, only the colors of some LCD's change. Arduinos bridge this gap and let you interact with the physical world from your computer.

As a little tiny microprocessor these are amazing because they let you program small pieces of hardware in ways that weren't possible before.  

600 Glowsticks

So you have a friend who has a wild spirit, or someone who's really a lot more into "experiences" then physical objects and don't know what to get them? There's nothing like 1000 glowsticks to really make their day a little memorable. 

These glowsticks last a surprisingly long time and can be chained together to make good quality little bracelets or acceptable necklaces. For about 25$ they really take a party from "I guess this was fun" to "Holy Hell."

This is a rare example of a gift that's equally great for a four year old and a college student.


Bluetooth Headphones

There's nothing more annyoing then the flapping headphones cord that slaps you while you're running and makes your earbuds fall out when you're about to run a personal record. These bluetooth headphones are great because they'll *never* get pulled off your head.

These will *just work* with an iPhone and every Android phone I've personally used. They worked with any laptop that has bluetooth installed and shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to get setup with.

P.S. Did I mention that you can change the track or the volume without taking out your phone? Not fumbling with my phone on the commute to work is an incredible luxury.

Sugru

This stuff is amazing and it's what I always wished Play-Doh had been. Sugru is an amazing quick drying rubber-like compound that I've used so far to

* fix my computers power cable, saving me the 80$ cost of replacement. 
* build a toothbrush holder
* replace the small little pad on the bottom of my computer that fell off.

If you want to get someone a gift that they'll remember as being incredibly awesome and handy, you can either buy them a roll of duck tape and be weirdly tacky, or you can give them a little pack of sugru and you'll be a part of their life forever.

Tea Tree Oil

Men who are reading this looking for a gift for a woman: Stop here and just get this. To be totally honest, I don't really understand the differences between cosmetic products. I'd be a really terrible Avon lady. I scrub my face with the cheap stuff from CVS and I seem to have avoided having exploding pores. But most women are on a whole different plane of cosmetics-existence. 

Do you know what non-comodogenic means? No? WHat about the difference between X or Y? No? You're not qualified for this. If you go in without help there's a real chance you'll buy something that implies she's ugly or that's for blackheads and she had one last week and I can't believe you. Just don't do it. You can't pick randomly, you need useful but innocuous. That's what this is. It's used for... I don't actually know. It's made out of... tea trees?  

Look, it will make her smile, whether it's your mom or your girlfriend.
